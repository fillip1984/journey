# Journey

Will be a monorepo (react native for app, next for web app and backend) that is my interpretation of the Bullet Journal method

## TODOS

- [ ] init workspace and get it to startup with create-t3-turbo repo example switching to PostGres for backend database and using Drizzle for RN local database
